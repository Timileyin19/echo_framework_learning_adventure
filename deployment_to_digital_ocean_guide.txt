DIGITAL OCEAN (Deployment steps)
1. Create >> Droplets >> Select the Nearest Data Center to you >> Ubuntu OS (Linux) >> CPU Option (Intel) >> $8/month >> 
2. SSH: To create this, goto your terminal, and type: ssh-keygen (keep pressing Enter-Enter till you get to the last stage)
	
Your identification has been saved in /Users/timmytech/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/timmytech/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:qkO6rcCWOtkN2dgiPeT9msCIVlUaAU2WxRhZ9xVPmgc timmytech@TIMMYTECH.local

1. To get your SSH, enter the following CMD in your terminal: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

ssh-rsa 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 timmytech@TIMMYTECH.local



2. paste the SSH-KEY in the digital ocean (go the SSH key method
3. Add free metrics and also add the option of Backend
4. Enter hostname (here I used ujblockchain)
5. Then click on “Create Droplets” 
6. This will take you to the project page and then on the resource, then click on it to be sure it is  done
7. Then go o ssh root@[YOUR_IP_AADDRESS] - the one that says ip4 e.g ssh root@206.189.31.94  
8. Then add user (instead of using the default “root” user that we were given by Digital Ocean) using the command: adduser [username] e.g adduser timileyin19
9. Enter the password of the User (do ensure that you remember the username and the password that you used)
10. Then enter the full name (name of the application) -  (Timileyin Abiodun), 
11. Give permission to the user created using the cpe; usermod -aG sudo [username_created] e.g usermod -aG sudo timileyin19
12. Then you can exist the server by pressing exit
13. Then you add permission ssh to the new user
		a. get the ssh key in a new tab/window using the cmd: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
		b. login with the root user: ssh root@[IP_Address]
		c. Enter into the new user directory:  cd /home/[username_created] e.g cd /home/timileyin19
		d. In the new user directory, enter the command:  mkdir .ssh, to create the folder where you will add the ssh-key file
		e. Then enter into the .ssh folder using the command:  cd .ssh
		f. create the file to store the ssh-key using the command: sudo nano authorized_keys. do ensure that the authorized_keys is spelt correctly
		g. Then copy and paste the your ssh-key into this place and then press ctrl + X , this will prompt you to ask if you want to save or not, ensure you press y
		h. Then type exit so that you can be logged out from this root user. 
		i. To get if this user has been successcfully created, just use the login command ssh [username]@[your_IP_Address]
		j. If it works, then it means that you have successfully created the user with adequate permission granted. 

14.  Remove the root User. Run the following command:
```
	# sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
change:  "permitRootUser: NO

// reload the sshd service
```
	# sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

// add firewall rules
```
	# sudo ufw app list								-> list all the apps that can be used with the firewall
	# sudo ufw allow OpenSSH						-> allow the OpenSSH app
	# sudo ufw enable								-> enable the firewall on the cloud
	# sudo ufw status									-> check the status of the firewall
```


// update every packages in your server
```
	# sudo apt-get update
	# sudo apt-get upgrade
```




// INSTAL GO
```
	# cd /tmp
	# ls 						-> the files that show-up here will be automatically deleted when you restart your server
	# wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.linux-amd64.tar.gz        -> get link to download the latest version of go for linux (which is your server version) - you can get the link online (go website >> download >> linux >> (copy the link) https://golang.google.cn/dl/go1.21.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz)
	# ls 								-> to check if the file has been downloaded. NB: do not log out until you are done as this will make the file to be deleted

	# sudo tar -xvf go1.21.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz 		-> extract the file to the local directory

	# sudo mv go /usr/local 						-> move the go folder to the local directory

	# sudo nano ~/.profile 						-> open the profile file to get the profile configuration

	# export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin 			-> add this to the profile file (this is the path where you install go)

	# exit 

	# ssh [username]@[IP_Address] 					-> login to the server again

	# cd /tmp										-> go to the temp directory

	# ls											-> check the files in the temp directory (to confirm if go is still there)

	# cd ..											-> come back to the root directory

	# go version									-> check the version of go installed (to confirm if go is installed)
```
